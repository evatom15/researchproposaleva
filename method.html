    <h1>Method and Design</h1>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p>For this project I think a questionnaire will be the best method for collecting data because I can gather many responses at once, and find if there is a majority answer or if responses are more varied. I want to hear perspectives from people in both Oregon and Washington, and this way I can send out the same questions to many different people, including people across state borders, in order to collect responses. I will start by sending the survey to students by recruiting them on campus using flyers and word of mouth. Participants will also be encouraged to share the survey with others. I will also send it by email to different groups, such as honors students, where I am able to connect with professors and leaders who can assist me. I will attempt the same approach for universities in Washington to gain perspectives from both states. I will also post flyers in different areas of Portland, and Seattle if possible, near places like arenas or stadiums where sports fans might see. To help encourage participation, an incentive, such as a gift card, may be offered in the form of a random drawing, similar to surveys PSU sends out occasionally. For this short-term project I think 10-15 surveys per state (20-30) overall is a realistic goal, but hopefully I can reach more people. I will phrase my questions how I have them phrased above.<br />
<ul>
         <li>Is there a rivalry between Seattle and Portland?</li><br />
 <li>Is there a rivalry between Washington and Oregon?</li><br />
 <li>What factors contribute to this rivalry?</li><br />
 <li>Is this a perceived rivalry, or is there more history/merit to it?</li><br />
 <li>Do people have different ideas about the rivalry and what causes it?</li><br />
 <li>What emotions do people associate with either of the two cities, and why?</li><br />
I will try to keep it general and let the people who take the surveys interpret them their own way, and modify if there is an obvious confusion with any questions. I am also considering doing a virtual ethnography by looking into hashtags related to Portland, Seattle, Oregon, Washington, sports teams, and other potentially relevant factors to the rivalry. This will help add on to the information I collect from questionnaires and give me information from a wide variety of people. The benefits of these methods is that it can give me lots of perspectives and data for this project, but one drawback is the possibility that I wonâ€™t get very in-depth insights. I am hoping the questionnaires will give me more specific details.
</p>
       <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>For my research project, variation in subjects is important to get a wide variety of perspectives on the topic. It is unclear if the rivalry is absolutely real, or if it is shared by everybody, or if it is more potent on one side of it. The more perspectives I can get from people of different backgrounds, different ages, different careers, etc. the more information I can get that might be relevant. I expect most of the responses to be from students, as that is the demographic that is most accessible to me. Luckily, there are a wide variety of students at PSU, so I can gather data from older students who may be longer-term residents, as well as a variety of people from different backgrounds. Sports fans will also be a largely reached demographic as a large group of them will frequently see my flyers posted near areas where various teams play.
