    <h1>Method and Design</h1>
      <h2>Method</h2>
      <p>For this project I think a questionnaire will be the best method for collecting data. I want to hear perspectives from people in both Oregon and Washington, and this way I can send out the same questions to many different people, including people across state borders, in order to collect responses. I will most likely start by sending it to students, because they are the most accessible to me, but also ask that people with parents, relatives, or friends living in Oregon or Washington send the survey to them so I can gather information from multiple age groups. For this short-term project I think 10-15 surveys per state (20-30) overall is a realistic goal, but hopefully I can reach more people. I will phrase my questions closely to how I have them phrased above. I will try to keep it general and let the people who take the surveys interpret them their own way, and modify if there is an obvious confusion with any questions. I am also considering doing a virtual ethnography by looking into hashtags related to Portland, Seattle, Oregon, Washington, sports teams, and other potentially relevant factors to the rivalry. This will help add on to the information I collect from questionnaires and give me information from a wide variety of people. The benefits of these methods is that it can give me lots of perspectives and data for this project, but one drawback is the possibility that I wonâ€™t get very in-depth insights. I am hoping the questionnaires will give me more specific details.

       <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>For my research project I think variation in subjects is important to get a wide variety of perspectives on the topic. It is unclear if the rivalry is absolutely real, or if it is shared by everybody, or if it is more potent on one side of it. The more perspectives I can get from people of different backgrounds, different ages, different careers, etc. the more information I can get that might be relevant. I am not completely sure, but I might exclude people who have not lived in Oregon or Washington for less than 5 years, because I think the perspective of someone from an outside state might be less understanding of the issue. However, it could also point to the influence of people from Oregon or Washington and how that plays into the rivalry.
