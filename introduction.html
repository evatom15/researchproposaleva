    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <h2>Possible research topic/question:</h2>
      <p>What is the reason for the rivalry or perceived rivalry between Seattle and Portland (or more broadly, Washington and Oregon)?</p>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>For this project I want to find out why people perceive a rivalry between Seattle and Portland. I am interested in this because of perspectives I have heard on the topic, which can range from someone perpetrating it because it is funny, or someone not perceiving any rivalry at all. I think it is worth studying to figure out if there is any real rivalry, and what the basis is for people who think there is one. I believe this would be a somewhat new understanding of the phenomenon, as it is hard to find research on the topic. I think this question is something psychological that stems from somewhat of a herd mentality, and I think it is important to know the why behind my question.
