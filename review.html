    <h1>Literature Review</h1>
      <p>In trying to find literature about this topic, I struggled to find any research about what I specifically want to study. The only literature I found about Oregon/Washington or Portland/Seattle having a rivalry was a Sports Illustrated article about Portland and Seattle soccer teams. This article is titled “A Pacific Passion Play” by Grant Wahl, and discusses the rivalry between the Seattle Sounders and Portland Timbers, which he says “dates to 1975” (Wahl). In his article, Wahl quotes both Joe Roth, the Sounders’ majority owner, and Sigi Schmid, the Sounders’ coach, who both say that the rivalry between Portland and Seattle is one of the best rivalries ever. Aside from this article, I found an article called “Regional City and Network City: Portland and Seattle in the Twentieth Century” by Carl Abbott. This article is a quantitative study that focuses mostly on economic aspects of the two cities, rather than any specific rivalry between the two. However, Abbott does say that Portland and Seattle “have long competed against each other for regional dominance,” which might be something to consider (Abbott 294). 
All other articles I could find related to both Seattle and Portland, or Washington and Oregon, would discuss a specific idea as related to the two cities/states, but were never any specific comparison. I also could not find any other literature that focused on people and how they relate to the dynamic between the two cities/states. The two somewhat relevant articles I found gave some background on the sports rivalry and the economic rivalry between Seattle and Portland. This gives me a little background knowledge, but there is a gap I can fill regarding people’s perceptions about the rivalry. There is more to be discovered about why people compare the two, and why people may think one is better than the other.
