    <h1>Rationale</h1>
      <h2>Questions I want to look at:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Is there a rivalry between Seattle and Portland?</li>
        <li>Is there a rivalry between Washington and Oregon?</li>
        <li>What factors contribute to this rivalry?</li>
        <li>Is this a perceived rivalry, or is there more history/merit to it?</li>
        <li>Do people have different ideas about the rivalry and what causes it?</li>
        <li>What emotions do people associate with either of the two cities, and why?</li>
        <p>I might come up with more specific questions as I go, but these questions will help me to figure out what people think about the rivalry. They are important to help me understand the mentality behind the perceived rivalry, and the reasons behind it. My claim/hypothesis as of right now is that this phenomenon stems from both sports rivalry, and from them being the two biggest cities in the Pacific northwest. If my hypothesis is confirmed, it will show how deeply sports fanaticism runs, or I will find a reason why there needs to be rivalry between the two big cities. If my hypothesis is disconfirmed, I will find out other reasoning behind this rivalry that maybe has not been considered. I might also find that the rivalry maybe only exists to some, or maybe how seriously people take it.
