    <h1>Procedure and Analysis</h1>
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <p>I will begin by sending the questionnaire by email to other students from Oregon or Washington, utilizing various universities and organizations to help spread the information. I will also post flyers in various student areas, sports arenas and stadiums, and various locations that are more populated and where more people are likely to find them. Participants will also be encouraged to spread the survey to other people they know living in Oregon or Washington in order to reach more people. All the participant will need to do is respond to the questions in the survey and submit it, and I will have it set up in a Google Form where all the responses can be collected online in one space. </p>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>I will analyze the results by separating the responses by state and looking through the answers in this specific grouping. I will code for similarities between them as individual states. I will then compare the results and code for similarities between all participants. I will also code for specific terms relating to sports, relating to nature, and relating to elements of the cities that may come up to see if there’s answers relating to my hypothesis. If the results tend to have more information about sports, nature, or city differences it will confirm my hypothesis towards potential reasons for the rivalry. If I find any information that shows one state senses the rivalry more than the other, or generally that some people perceive it and others don’t, or any information about the cause of the rivalry not related to the above categories, my hypothesis will be disproved. In this case, my coding will be more inductive, rather than deductive, as I will have to find patterns that I did not anticipate beforehand.
