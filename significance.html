    <h1>Significance</h1>
      <p>This research would be a significant contribution to the field, as there is no specific research on the rivalry between the two states. This will reveal information about if the rivalry really exists, if it is on one side or both, and why it exists. The results will be interesting because it is not as obvious of a rivalry, and it is something that is more contained to a small area. As someone from outside of Oregon and Washington I am interested because I did not know before coming here that there was any sort of rivalry between the states, and it is interesting because they are so similar. The reasoning behind a smaller scale rivalry might reveal a lot about the citizens of the two states, and how the habitants perceive the areas they live in.</p>
